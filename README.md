A simple streamlit based web application in order to find duplicates in a corpus of images using perceptual hashing, uploaded by the user.

4. By default, streamlit allows us to upload files of **max. 200MB**. If you want to have more size for uploading images, execute the command :
```
streamlit run app.py --server.maxUploadSize=1028
```

### Running the Dockerized App
1. Ensure you have Docker Installed and Setup in your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux). For detailed Instructions, please refer [this.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository ( where the ***Dockerfile*** is present ).
3. Build the Docker Image (don't forget the dot!! :smile: ): 
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t app:latest .
```
4. Run the docker:
```
docker run -p 8501:8501 app:latest
```

This will launch the dockerized app. Navigate to ***http://localhost:8501/*** in your browser to have a look at your application. You can check the status of your all available running dockers by:
